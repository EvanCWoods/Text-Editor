## Description
This app is an online text editor that allows programmers to write code snippets in the browser and store them for later. The app is a PWA and allows users to download the program and run it locally on their machine offline. This is done using webpack.

The user is immediately shown the text editor on arrival at the website, which will automatically save the written contents. 

The download button on the top left allows the user to use a copy of the app locally using chromes tools.
